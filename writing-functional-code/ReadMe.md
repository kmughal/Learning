# Functional Programming C#

Most of us see C-Sharp as a language in which we write either procedural code or object oriented code. But this language is rich enough to support the basic principles or functional code. Things to consider when writing functional code are:

- Pure functions
- Functional compositions ( Can be think of a method chaining.)
- Monads ( a class / type which behaves in a common way)
- Referential Transparency ( you can figure out about method by looking on the parameters  / arguments )
- Function honesty ( should inform in full about input / produced output)
- Functions are first class citizens
- HOF (Higher order function) function which takes other functions as arguments.
